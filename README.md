Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Hayden and I am a computer scientist, educator, and aspiring game developer. I graduated from the University of St. Thomas this past spring in May of 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a double minor in Teacher Education and Applied Statistics.

I began learning to program in fall of 2021 at St. Thomas. As an individual who specializes in math and problem solving, computer science turned out to be a good fit. As I continued to pursue further education, I continued to become a better, more efficient programmer. Now having graduated, I am still looking to grow in my coding knowledge and understanding. 

In fall of 2024, I took my talents to Maranatha Christian Academy (MCA). MCA is a private K-12 Christian school based in Brooklyn Park, MN, "endeavoring to build unity by creating a kingdom culture that challenges and equips students, parents, and staff to respect and value all people according to Godâ€™s Word." As a follower of Christ who has a passion for computer science, education, and impacting the next generation, this has been a perfect fit. I currently am a STEM teacher for middle and high school, teaching various computer science and STEM related courses. Coding is an incredible way to develop your problem-solving skills, and it has been a blast connecting with and furthering the education of this next generation. I love teaching and cannot continue to use my skills to impact everyone at MCA for the glory of God and betterment of this world. I currently teach Python and a general computer science class, where we learn about topics ranging from information security to assembly language and discrete math. It has been an amazing opportunity and I am incredibly grateful to be in the position I am in.

Toward the end of the school year, I began learning how to game develop. With Python being my strongest language, I decided to begin looking into Godot. Godot uses the built-in language GDScript, which has a very similar syntax to Python. As a result, it was very easy for me to pick up! You will notice a few repositories connected to my GitHub relating to game development. The first is a practice platformer that I began working on to get comfortable with the game engine. This game runs well but ultimately serves little purpose as a game, but rather is a showcase of some of the things I have been learning how to code and develop. The second is an actual game project that me and a small development team have begun working on. This is the 'BCB Casino Simulator', which will focus on creating 2D casino games. I have worked on various parts of the game so far, with the menu screen and roulette logic being the primary parts. The goal for me and our small dev team is to continue learning Godot through working on small projects, and that hopefully, one day, we will be able to create a fully playable 2D RPG. As a programmer, student, and now teacher, I love learning. I am excited to continue working on these projects to further my knowledge and strengths in the computer science world!

Here is a list of all coding languages I have worked in. The languages near the top are my strongest, and the ones near the bottom I have some experience with, but not as much. Feel free to look around the rest of my page, as I have other GitHub repositories displaying old labs and projects I worked on throughout the course of my college career!
