Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Hayden and I am a computer scientist, educator, and aspiring game developer. I graduated from the University of St. Thomas this past spring in May of 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a double minor in Teacher Education and Applied Statistics.

I began learning to program in fall of 2021 at St. Thomas. As an individual who specializes in math and problem solving, computer science turned out to be a good fit. As I continued to pursue further education, I continued to become a better, more efficient programmer. Now having graduated, I am still looking to grow in my coding knowledge and understanding. I am taking my talents to Maranatha Christian Academy this fall in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, where I will be teaching various computer science and STEM related courses! Programming is a really unique way to further one's cognitive development, and I cannot wait to help the next generation in such a way.

Toward the end of the school year, I began learning how to game develop. With Python being my strongest language, I decided to begin looking into Godot. Godot uses the built-in language GDScript, which has a very similar syntax to Python. As a result, it was very easy for me to pick up! You will notice a few repositories connected to my GitHub relating to game development. The first is a practice platformer that I began working on to get comfortable with the game engine. This game runs well but ultimately serves little purpose as a game, but rather is a showcase of some of the things I have been learning how to code and develop. The second is an actual game project that me and a small development team have begun working on. This is the 'BCB Casino Simulator', which will focus on creating 2D casino games. I have worked on various parts of the game so far, with the menu screen and roulette logic being the primary parts. The goal for me and our small dev team is to continue learning Godot through working on small projects, and that hopefully, one day, we will be able to create a fully playable 2D RPG. As a programmer, student, and now teacher, I love learning. I am excited to continue working on these projects to further my knowledge and strengths in the computer science world!

Here is a list of all coding languages I have worked in. The languages near the top are my strongest, and the ones near the bottom I have some experience with, but not as much. Feel free to look around the rest of my page, as I have other GitHub repositories displaying old labs and projects I worked on throughout the course of my college career!
